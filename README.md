# HelloWorld1 Smart Contract

This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity.

## Contract Details

The `HelloWorld1` contract implements a basic token with minting and burning functionality. Below are the details of the contract.

### Public Variables

- **tokenName**: The name of the token, initialized as "Ritil".
- **tokenAbbrv**: The abbreviation of the token, initialized as "MTA".
- **totalSupply**: The total supply of the token, initialized as 0.

### Mapping

- **balances**: A mapping from addresses to their respective token balances.

### Functions

#### `mint(address _address, uint _value)`

This function increases the total supply of the token and credits the specified address with the minted tokens.

- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address to receive the minted tokens.
  - `_value`: The amount of tokens to mint.

#### `burn(address _address, uint _value)`

This function decreases the total supply of the token and debits the specified address by the burned tokens, provided they have sufficient balance.

- **Parameters**:
  - `_address`: The address to have the tokens burned from.
  - `_value`: The amount of tokens to burn.

## Usage

1. **Deploying the Contract**: Use a development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat to deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Minting Tokens**: Call the `mint` function with the recipient's address and the number of tokens to mint.
3. **Burning Tokens**: Call the `burn` function with the address to burn from and the number of tokens to burn.

## Example

Here is an example of how to interact with the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract HelloWorld1 {
    // Public variables here
    string public tokenName = "Ritil";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "MTA";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;
    
    // Mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;
    
    // Mint function
    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // Burn function
    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _value, "Insufficient balance to burn");
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }
}
```

1. **Deploy the contract** using a development environment like Remix.
2. **Mint 100 tokens** to an address:
   ```solidity
   myToken.mint(0xYourAddress, 100);
   ```
3. **Check the balance** of the address:
   ```solidity
   uint balance = myToken.balances(0xYourAddress);
   ```
4. **Burn 50 tokens** from the address:
   ```solidity
   myToken.burn(0xYourAddress, 50);
   ```
5. **Check the updated balance** of the address:
   ```solidity
   uint updatedBalance = myToken.balances(0xYourAddress);
   ```
